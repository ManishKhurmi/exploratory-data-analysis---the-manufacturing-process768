# Project 2 

# Startegy for machine_failures:

# Impact of strategy 
    [X] Write code that shows the impact on production for the threshold given per variable

# stationary point strategy 
    [X] Calculates the ideal-scientific approach to where the thresholds should be implemented 
        [X] create a func that turns the minima_cordinate dict into unscaled dictionary. Do this by asking gpt to create a func based on injesting the df and the dictionary along with context over which scaler was used 
    [X] Do this by writing code that plots this stationay point on the logistic curve as a vertical dotted line & cross.

# Paiplot of explanatory vas vs explanatory vars
    [] See conversation with Jared on 16/10/2024

# Import the impact of strategy from analysis and visualisation 


# Future improvements:
- widget that tells you the impact 
    - impact on: # Production, Revenue (profit - loss) and Failure rate. Profit can be assumed by giving a profit from each product e.g. L = £1, M = £2 ...etc
