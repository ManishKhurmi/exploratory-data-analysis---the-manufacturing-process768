# Project 2 

# Startegy for machine_failures:

# Impact of strategy 
    [X] Write code that shows the impact on production for the threshold given per variable

# stationary point strategy 
    [] Calculates the idea-scientific approach to where the thresholds should be implemented 
        [] create a func that turns the minima_cordinate dict into unscaled dictionary. Do this by asking gpt to create a func based on injesting the df and the dictionary along with context over which scaler was used 
    [] Do this by writing code that plots this stationay point on the logistic curve as a vertical dotted line & cross.
