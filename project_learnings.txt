Use Classes & Methods to make the EDA process more efficient 
Use .ipynb files for visualisation & analysis 
label variables well to ensure there are not overwriting issues in the code 
create seperate scripts for testing classes when needed, have a main script that shows the whole thought process

Are measures of Skewness useful for Binary Data? Elaborate on your answer.
- Binary data is another form of categorical data, to which measures of skew are not very useful. 
- Instead use measures of frequency. 
- Might be worthwhile looking at logistic regression for modelling the relationship between the binary dependant variable and one or more independant variables.
- Measures of skew are however useful for continous data. 

Learn the theory behind the normality & skewness tests

When applyting data transformation steps e.g. cleaning, correcting for skewness, 
- create a copy of the data frame & rename the variables. This ensures reproducability. As a check, re-run the code block. 
- check for null values as a result of the transformation. 

Why do I need to include 'self' as a parameter for any method I define in a class?
- Method binding. As the init parameter is parsed first by python any subsequent method in the class needs to bind with the __init__ func of said class.
- This binding allows the method to be aware of the instance it is operating on.
- Even if I do not need access to the information in the __init__ func of a class, I still need to define 'self' as a parameter for any method.

lean code with treating for skewness or other statical methods:
- perform the whole end-to-end on one parameter first then create functions for classes, to apply the same methods to other parameters 

Project decisions
- box plots > scatter plots 


if a transformation is made on a column. Rename said column. For example if the skewness transformation on air_temp was kept then rename that column 


Explain what degrees of freedom (df) is, in the context of statistics?
- `df` determines the number of values in a calculaiton that are free to vary. 
- We can think of it as the number of independent pieces of information needed to estimate a statical parameter.
- Chisquared example: (Number of rows - 1) * (Number of columns - 1)
-(2 - 1) * (2 - 1) = 1, Therefore 1 df for out 2 x 2 table, knowing the totals for each row and column, we only need 1 cells value to determine all the other values in our table

Explain the concept of a p-value in statistics?
- The p-value is a number that helps us understand the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis, which is the assumption that there is no relationship between the variables being studied 
- A low p-value suggestions strong evidence against the null hypothesis.

What is the Null Hypothesis?
- The null hypothesis is a well defined statement to test whether there's evidence for a particular effect or association. 
- (H0): is a statement that there is no affect, no difference, no association between variables. It serves as the starting point for statistical testing.  


#### Notes for the project 
- models that for binary data 
- is normalising the air temperature worth it? - in correcting for the skew, we lose the meaningful information that the variable contains 

#### How can i create tests so that the issue of labelling data, overighting data etc
