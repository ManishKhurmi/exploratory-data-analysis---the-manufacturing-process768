Use Classes & Methods to make the EDA process more efficient 
Use .ipynb files for visualisation & analysis 
label variables well to ensure there are not overwriting issues in the code 
create seperate scripts for testing classes when needed, have a main script that shows the whole thought process

Are measures of Skewness useful for Binary Data? Elaborate on your answer.
- Binary data is another form of categorical data, to which measures of skew are not very useful. 
- Instead use measures of frequency. 
- Might be worthwhile looking at logistic regression for modelling the relationship between the binary dependant variable and one or more independant variables.
- Measures of skew are however useful for continous data. 

Learn the theory behind the normality & skewness tests

When applyting data transformation steps e.g. cleaning, correcting for skewness, 
- create a copy of the data frame & rename the variables. This ensures reproducability. As a check, re-run the code block. 
- check for null values as a result of the transformation. 

Why do I need to include 'self' as a parameter for any method I define in a class?
- Method binding. As the init parameter is parsed first by python any subsequent method in the class needs to bind with the __init__ func of said class.
- This binding allows the method to be aware of the instance it is operating on.
- Even if I do not need access to the information in the __init__ func of a class, I still need to define 'self' as a parameter for any method.

lean code with treating for skewness or other statical methods:
- perform the whole end-to-end on one parameter first then create functions for classes, to apply the same methods to other parameters
