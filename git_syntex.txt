When setting up a repository, it's a good idea to do the following:

1. Create a remote repository
2. Clone the remote repository into your local machine.

# Current directory
pwd

# Navigate to a current path 
cd /path/to/your/project

# Initialise Git - Stage - Commit - Push
git init 
git add 
git commit -m 
git push 

# Gives the names of all the files in a specified branch
git ls-tree -r --name_only <branch_name>
# see the names of the files on the current branch
git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD 

# Connecting to a remote repo
git remote add origin <URL>
.
# checking if local repo is connected to a remote repo
git remote -v

# making a local copy of the repo
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

# Check for the .git Directory:
# Ensure that there is a .git directory within your project directory (meta data)
ls -a 

# Make sure that local version of 'main' is the same as remote
# It's best practice to have an up-to-date version of main when adding a new feature 
git fetch origin main

# Add all untrached files
git add.

# Push a new branch to a remote repo 
git push -u origin feature-2
# Pushing a branch upstream that has not been connected to the remote repo
git push --set-upstream origin enhancement-N    

ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/Desktop/Learning_VSCode/example-key/ -C manish_khurmi@hotmail.co.uk

# Using curl to open up downloads, example from Advanced Python -> Debugging -> Notebook -> The following solution (in BASH):
curl -O https://aicore-files.s3.amazonaws.com/Foundations/Python_Programming/example.py

# deleting a branch on the remote repo 
git push origin --delete <branch_name>
